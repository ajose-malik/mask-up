#### Built by: Malik Ajose

### Project Description:
Mask/Up sheds a light on the impact of COVID-19 within the context of the United States. The total cases in the United States at the moment is over 14.9 million, and the current death toll is over 275,000. Although Covid-19 is imperceivable to the naked eye, it is as real as the air we breathe.

The [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data) at *The Atlantic* is the data source for this project.
For information on Covid-19 racial disparities, refer to [The COVID Tracking Project Racial Data Dashboard](https://covidtracking.com/race/dashboard).

### Technologies:
I developed this project using functional programming with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. This project also uses local storage to store fetched data; and in doing so, any fetched data persists on the browser until it's manually refreshed.
